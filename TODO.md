# To-do

These are ideas I have for additional functionality. Some may actually get implemented.

## Concurrency

Erlang/Go send-receive/channel: Built on their lightweight processes mechanisms, both
Erlang and Go support message passing send/receive loops between processes. The heavyweight
threads in Ruby make long-lived send/receive loops compelling.
