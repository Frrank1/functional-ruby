  # An immutable data structure with multiple members, only one of which
  # can be set at any given time. A `Union` is a convenient way to bundle a
  # number of member attributes together, using accessor methods, without having
  # to write an explicit class.
  #
  # The `Union` module generates new `AbstractUnion` subclasses that hold a set of
  # members with one and only one value associated with a single member. For each
  # member a reader method is created along with a predicate and a factory. The
  # predicate method indicates whether or not the give member is set. The reader
  # method returns the value of that member or `nil` when not set. The factory
  # creates a new union with the appropriate member set with the given value.
  #
  # A `Union` is very similar to a Ruby `Struct` and shares many of its behaviors
  # and attributes. Where a `Struct` can have zero or more values, each of which is
  # assiciated with a member, a `Union` can have one and only one value. Unlike a
  # Ruby `Struct`, a `Union` is immutable: its value is set at construction and
  # it can never be changed. Divergence between the two classes derive from these
  # two core differences.
  #
  # @example
  # 
  #   LeftRightCenter = Functional::Union.new(:left, :right, :center) #=> LeftRightCenter
  #   LeftRightCenter.ancestors #=> [LeftRightCenter, Functional::AbstractUnion... ]
  #   LeftRightCenter.members   #=> [:left, :right, :center]
  #   
  #   prize = LeftRightCenter.right('One million dollars!') #=> #<union LeftRightCenter... >
  #   prize.members #=> [:left, :right, :center]
  #   prize.values  #=> [nil, "One million dollars!", nil]
  #   
  #   prize.left?   #=> false
  #   prize.right?  #=> true
  #   prize.center? #=> false
  #   
  #   prize.left    #=> nil
  #   prize.right   #=> "One million dollars!"
  #   prize.center  #=> nil
