# PatternMatching [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jdantonio/pattern_matching.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jdantonio/pattern_matching?branch=master) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/jdantonio/pattern_matching.png)](https://gemnasium.com/jdantonio/pattern_matching)

A gem for adding Erlang-style pattern matching to Ruby classes.

*NOTE: This is a work in progress. Expect changes.*

## Introduction

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is my favorite programming by far. As much as I love Ruby I've always been a little disappointed that Ruby doesn't support function overloading. Function overloading tends to reduce branching and keep functions signatures simpler. No sweat, I learned to do without. Then I started programming in [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)â€¦

I've really started to enjoy working in Erlang. Erlang is good at all the things Ruby is bad at and vice versa. Together, Ruby and Erlang make me happy. My favotite Erlang feature is, without question, [pattern matching](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/syntax-in-functions#pattern-matching). Pattern matching is like function overloading cranked to 11. So one day I was musing on Twitter and one of my friends responded with "Build it!" So I did. And here it is.

### Goals

* Stay true to the spirit of Erlang pattern matching, if not the semantics
* Keep the semantics as idiomatic Ruby as possible
* Support features that make sense in Ruby
* Exclude features that only make sense in Erlang
* Avoid using #method_missing

### Features

* Basic pattern matching for instance methods.
* Parameter count matching
* Mathing against primitive values
* Matching by class/datatype
* Matching against specific key/vaue pairs in hashes
* Matching against the presence of keys within hashes
* Reasonable error messages when no match is found
* Dispatching to superclass methods when no match is found
* Recursive calls to other pattern matches
* Recursive calls to superclass methods

### To-do

* Variable-length argument lists
* Matching against array elements
* Guard clauses
* Support class methods
* Support module instance methods
* Support module methods

## Install

```shell
gem install pattern-matching
```

or add the following line to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pattern-matching
```

and run `bundle install` from your shell.

## Supported Ruby versions

MRI 1.9.x and above. Anything else and your mileage may vary.

## Examples

For more examples see the integration tests in *spec/integration_spec.rb*.

### Simple Functions

This example is based on [Syntax in defnctions: Pattern Matching](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/syntax-in-defnctions) in [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/).

Erlang:

```erlang
greet(male, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, Mr. ~s!", [Name]);
greet(female, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, Mrs. ~s!", [Name]);
greet(_, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, ~s!", [Name]).
```

Ruby:

```ruby
require 'pattern_matching'

class Foo
  include PatternMatching

  defn(:greet, _) do |name|
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end

  defn(:greet, :male, _) { |name|
    "Hello, Mr. #{name}!"
  }
  defn(:greet, :female, _) { |name|
    "Hello, Ms. #{name}!"
  }
  defn(:greet, _, _) { |_, name|
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  }
end
```

### Simple Functions with Overloading

This example is based on [Syntax in defnctions: Pattern Matching](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/syntax-in-defnctions) in [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/).

Erlang:

```erlang
greet(Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, ~s!", [Name]).

greet(male, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, Mr. ~s!", [Name]);
greet(female, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, Mrs. ~s!", [Name]);
greet(_, Name) ->
  io:format("Hello, ~s!", [Name]).
```

Ruby:

```ruby
require 'pattern_matching'

class Foo
  include PatternMatching

  defn(:greet, _) do |name|
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end

  defn(:greet, :male, _) { |name|
    "Hello, Mr. #{name}!"
  }
  defn(:greet, :female, _) { |name|
    "Hello, Ms. #{name}!"
  }
  defn(:greet, nil, _) { |name|
    "Goodbye, #{name}!"
  }
  defn(:greet, _, _) { |_, name|
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  }
end
```

### Matching by Class/Datatype

Ruby:

```ruby
require 'pattern_matching'

class Foo
  include PatternMatching

  defn(:concat, Integer, Integer) { |first, second|
    first + second
  }
  defn(:concat, Integer, String) { |first, second|
    "#{first} #{second}"
  }
  defn(:concat, String, String) { |first, second|
    first + second
  }
  defn(:concat, Integer, _) { |first, second|
    first + second.to_i
  }
end
```

### Matching a Hash Parameter

Ruby:

```ruby
require 'pattern_matching'

class Foo
  include PatternMatching

  defn(:hashable, {foo: :bar}) { |opts|
    # matches any hash with key :foo and value :bar
    :foo_bar
  }
  defn(:hashable, {foo: _}) { |opts|
    # matches any hash with :key foo regardless of value
    :foo_unbound
  }
  defn(:hashable, {}) { |opts|
    # matches any hash
    :unbound_unbound
  }
end
```
